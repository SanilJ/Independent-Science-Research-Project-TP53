Abstract: 
The gene TP53 provides the genetic sequence for p53, a tumor suppressor protein that
prevents uncontrolled cell growth and keeps tumors from forming; p53 been deemed the
“guardian of the genome” due to its important role in the human body. Mutations in the p53
protein and the TP53 genome can be analyzed using its non-synonymous single nucleotide
polymorphisms (nsSNPs) and by classifying which existing SNPs have to lead to malignant
or benign tumors. nsSNPs, according to many studies, have been classified to have a lasting
effect on the phenotype of a human and 50% of cancers can be attributed to p53 mutations.
Currently, there is no reliable model to predict whether a mutation in the TP53 genome will
lead to a benign or malignant tumor, however, a more accurate model can be programmed
by creating an algorithm which uses existing malignant polymorphism identifications to learn
and find a way to differentiate based on the polymorphism sequences. A classifier was
engineered for this purpose using the principles of supervised learning in machine learning to
carry about this function and yielded a 92.86% accuracy and a low alarm rate.
